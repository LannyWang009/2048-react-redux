# 2048 - React - Redux
This is a front-end project of building the game 2048 using React and Redux technologies. 

User can use arrow keys to push and merge the number squares in four directions. The goal is to join the number 2048. If all squares are occupied, the user fails the game. 

Need to :
1) fix the mergeleft(shiftMatrixLeft) bug with score
2) deployment error on github
3) add the local storage and mount to lifecycle functions
